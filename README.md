Forest, bush, or vegetarian fire, can be described as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, etc. In this article we are not determining if a forest fire will take place or not, we are predicting the confidence of the forest fire based on some attributes.

Climate change and wildfires United Nation’s sustainable goals focus on delivering specified targets by 2030, which deals with education, poverty, climate change, and marine life to name a few. UN’s Environmental Program is responsible for coordinating the UN’s environmental activities and assisting developing countries in having environmentally sound policies and practices. We have 10 years to reach the targets and achieve the indicators that point to the success of the sustainable development initiative by the United Nations. A flourishing environment has a direct impact on all the 17 sustainable development goals laid down by the united nations, and hence it is one of the major agendas of united nations to protect and preserve the environment from both natural and man-made disasters. Wildfires indeed have affected the climate change, according to various reports by United Nations. With higher temperatures across the globe, the probability of wildfires is seen to be increasing, and they have a major impact on climate change. In 2019, Australia encountered one of the most disastrous fires in history, burning down about 18 million hectares of land (compared to nearly half of California), caused due to an extremely high-temperature season. The increasing temperatures create a high flammable condition in forests and grasslands. Similarly, Amazon forest also caught fires in 2019 leading to 2,240,000 acres of burnt area. Most recently, in 2020, the wildfire in California burnt down an area of 4,359,517 acres. There are an enormous amount of CO2 and greenhouse gases that are emitted with wildfires, which in turn increases the global temperature. The particles of the fires are carried long-distance and cause air pollution. These particles also deposit over snow and cause higher absorption of the sunlight. This phenomenon is known as a climate feedback loop which incrementally deteriorates the climate conditions.[
